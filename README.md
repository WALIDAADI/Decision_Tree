# Decision Tree Classifier Comparison

This project compares the performance of different decision tree algorithms (CART, ID3, and C4.5) on a sample dataset (Iris dataset). The goal is to understand how these algorithms function and evaluate their accuracy and classification performance.

## Description
This project explores the implementation and comparison of three decision tree algorithms:
- CART (Classification and Regression Trees)
- ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)
- C4.5 (successor of ID3)

We use the **Iris dataset** to train and test the models and compare their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation
